MoeDice
=======

We are trying to write a bot runing on Google App Engine for Google Plus.

and including an example to make it a Dicing Bot.

MoeDice is disigned in two parts,and that's why the codes was plase into two folders:
1.server
folder 'server' is the GAE app you need to upload to Google
this part is used to check Google Plus notifications update and call your bot to parse the posts.
it may be not a good idea to edit this part at most of the time.
but if you need to make hacking or fix some bugs,just do it.

2.LocalControl
folder 'LocalControl' includes a SDK-like tool that you can easily only upload you bot to you GAE app.
in this part you only need to edit config.py which include all your configurations.

and bot.py which is your bot.problems in writing the bot.py you can check the file bot-format.py 
which promote the formats and essentials in writing bot.py .
and for more ,we have a bot-example.py .it is a dicing bot example.

WARNING
=======
bot.py,config.py and app.yaml are just configuration files.so you have no need to release modifications of this two file.

read the "README" file in each folder for more information.

Usetage
=======
server:
1.edit app.yaml
2.use google app engine SDK to upload it to google's server
LocalControl
1.make sure your app has been upload to google correctly
2.config the config.py
3.write a bot.py or you can copy bot-example.py as bot.py
4.run 'update.py'
